<h2>Intro</h2>
<hr>
    <p>Pangolin Intro Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient
        Greek <span>φολῐ́ς</span>, "horny scale").
        The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four
        species found in Asia,
        while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa.
        These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also
        known.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
<hr>
    <p> Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this
        feature.
        They live in hollow <a href ="http://www.google.com">trees</a> or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists
        of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long tongues.
        They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a litter of one to three offspring, which
        they raise for about two years.</p>

        M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as critically endangered, three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis
        crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) <sup><a href="source.com"></a>[2]</sup> are listed as endangered and two
